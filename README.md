# BlobFight

BlobFight is based on .io games like Agar.io.  The program is designed to be run on one computer with two players.
There are two sides, red vs. blue.
Each player races to collect "food blobs" which will grow the player blobs in size.
The larger a player becomes, the faster their opponent will move.
A player wins when they envelop the opposing player.

NOTE:

Food blobs will never be bigger than the smallest player.

The background color is dynamic, showing which player is in the lead.

A winner's message will notify players of the winning blob.

There is a size limit, so players will not get too big.

Controls are WASD for the blue blob and arrow keys for the red blob.

Happy BlobFighting!
